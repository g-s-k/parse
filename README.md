# parsley

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/g-s-k/parsley.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/g-s-k/parsley)

what if scheme...but rust. still working on a backronym.

`cargo install parsley` installs the interpreter - see the
[docs](https://docs.rs/parsley) if you want to use it as a library.

## on the horizon

- improve test coverage, especially e2e tests
- (eventually) build on stable. blockers are:
  - `box_patterns` feature
  - `quicli` dependency
